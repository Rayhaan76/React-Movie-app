# React TypeScript project

This app uses React and TypeScript.

The app displays a list of 100 popular comedy movies. 
The list is filterable with the search input and sorted using the sort button.

Note: One bug that may arise is that a movie sometimes get stuck at the top of the list when sorting, I am unsure as to what is causing this bug.
